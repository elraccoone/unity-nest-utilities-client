# Documentation

The package revolves around the CrudService. Extending this service will grant you methods to call upon the endpoints generated by [Nest Utilities](https://github.com/MartinDrost/nest-utilities) as well as the available options provided by the chainable request builder. Each service revolves around it's respective serializable resource model.

## Getting started

Start off by creating a service for each of your resources. This is as simple as creating a new class and extending the CRUD Service provided by the Namespace. Extend the constructor with some basic parameters and your Model's Type. The Model's Type is responsible for transfering data in our resource's format.

```csharp
using ElRaccoone.NestUtilitiesClient;

public class UserService : CrudService<User> {
  public UserService () : base (
    hostname: "my-awesome-api.com",
    resource: "user"
  ) { }
}
```

To use your newly created Service, simply create an instance somewhere in your application. Preferably in some sort of Network Component. To get started with your first request, use one for the CRUD methods such as Get, Post, Delete or Patch provided by your Service. Once instanciated, a newly created Request Builder will be returned.

```csharp
public class TestComponent : MonoBehaviour {
  private UserService userService = new UserService ();

  private void Test () {
    this.userService.Get ();
    this.userService.Get (id: "...");
    this.userService.Post (model: new User (...));
    this.userService.Patch (model: new User (...));
    this.userService.Delete (id: "...");
  }
}
```

Once created your Request using the Builder, it's time to send it over to your API. To do this, yield the Send method provided by the builder. This will start the request and send over your data over to the server.

```csharp
public class TestComponent : MonoBehaviour {
  private UserService userService = new UserService ();

  private IEnumerator Test () {
    yield return this.userService.Get ().Send ();
  }
}
```

To confirm a request was successful, or get the response body of it, use the GetResponse method after sending your Request. When something went wrong, a request exception will be thrown containing information to debug the problem. Use the GetRawResponse method in order to get the raw response data, this method can also throw an exception.

```csharp
public class TestComponent : MonoBehaviour {
  private UserService userService = new UserService ();

  private IEnumerator Test () {
    var request = this.userService.Get ();
    yield return request.Send();
    try {
      var users = request.GetResponse ();
    }
    catch (RequestException exception) {
      Debug.Log (exception.statusCode);
    }
  }
}
```

## Chainable Options

#### Populate

This parameter allows you to populate references to other collections in the response.

```csharp
public RequestBuilder<ModelType> Populate (params string[] fields);
```

#### Select

This parameter allows you to define which fields you want the results to contain. If one or more fields have been selected for a layer, the remaining layers will be omitted from the response. You can deep select fields by separating fields using a dot (f.e. brewers.name).

```csharp
public RequestBuilder<ModelType> Select (params string[] fields);
```

#### Sort

This parameter allows you to sort the response data on one or more fields in the desired order.

```csharp
public RequestBuilder<ModelType> Sort (params string[] fields);
```

This parameter allows you to sort the response data on one or more fields in the desired order. Define one or more sorting options.

```csharp
public RequestBuilder<ModelType> Sort (string field, SortingOption sortingOptions);
```

#### Match Exact

This parameter allows you to match the response data on a specific exact value on a specific field including the casing.

```csharp
public RequestBuilder<ModelType> MatchExact (string field, string value);
```

#### Match Regex

This parameter allows you to match the response data based on a regex filter on a specific field.

```csharp
public RequestBuilder<ModelType> MatchRegex (string field, string value);
```

This parameter allows you to match the response data based on a regex filter on a specific field. One or more matching options will be translated into regex options.

```csharp
public RequestBuilder<ModelType> MatchRegex (string field, string value, MatchingOption matchingOptions);
```

#### Offset

This parameter allows you to skip the first n number of results.

```csharp
public RequestBuilder<ModelType> Offset (int amount);
```

#### Limit

This parameter allows you to limit the response to only show the next n number of results.

```csharp
public RequestBuilder<ModelType> Limit (int amount);
```

#### Distinct

This parameter allows you to find the distinct values for a specified field. The returned models will each contain unique values for that field. When multiple models in the actual response would have the same value, the first encountered model will be chosen based on the sort attribute.

```csharp
public RequestBuilder<ModelType> Distinct (string field);
```

#### Random

This parameter allows you to randomize the order of the response data. This parameter holds priority over the sort parameter which means that the sort will be omitted when random is defined.

```csharp
public RequestBuilder<ModelType> Random ();
```

## Writing Middleware

Out of the box the CrudService will supplement your extended class with a basic methods to execute your calls. In a lot of cases you'll want to and define headers to send along with your requests.

You can extend this behaviour by creating a new MiddleWare class which exposes a set of build in middleware methods. In this new class it is possible to override abstract methods which help you tailor the middleware with ease.

```csharp
using ElRaccoone.NestUtilitiesClient;

public class CustomMiddleware : RequestMiddleware {
  public override Header[] GetHeaders () => new Header[] {
    new Header (name: "Authorization", value: "...")
  };
}
```

```csharp
using ElRaccoone.NestUtilitiesClient;

public class UserService : CrudService<User> {
  public UserService () : base (
    hostname: "my-awesome-api.com",
    resource: "user",
    requestMiddleware: new CustomMiddleware()
  ) { }
}
```

## Custom Service Methods

When the default CRUD service does not cover all your needs, then it is possible to extend your class with some custom methods as shown below.

```csharp
using ElRaccoone.NestUtilitiesClient;
using ElRaccoone.NestUtilitiesClient.Core;

public class UserService : CrudService<User> {
  public UserService () : base (
    hostname: "my-awesome-api.com",
    resource: "user"
  ) { }

  public RequestBuilder<User> SomethingCustom (string value) =>
    new RequestBuilder<User> (
      requestMiddleware: this.requestMiddleware,
      requestMethod: RequestMethod.POST,
      url: string.Join ("/", this.url, "somethingcustom", value),
      model: new User ());
}
```
