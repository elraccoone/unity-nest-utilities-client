# Installation

Install the latest stable release using the Unity Package Manager by adding the following line to your `manifest.json` file located within your project's Packages directory.

```json
"nl.elraccoone.nest-utilities-client": "git+https://github.com/elraccoone/unity-nest-utilities-client"
```

# Documentation

The package revolves around the CrudService. Extending this service will grant you methods to call upon the endpoints generated by nest-utilities as well as the available options provided by the chainable request builder.

## Getting started

Creating a service for your resource is as simple as creating a new class and extending the crud service followed by some basic parameters and your model's type. Every resource gets their own Service.

```csharp
using ElRaccoone.NestUtilitiesClient;

public class UserService : CrudService<User> {
  public UserService () : base (
    hostname: "my-awesome-api.com",
    resource: "user",
    useInsecureProtocol: false
  ) { }
}
```

To use your newly created service, create an instance somewhere in your application. To get started with your first request, use one for the CRUD methods such as Get, Post, Delete or Patch. Once invoked, a request builder will be returned.

```csharp
public class TestComponent : MonoBehaviour {
  private UserService userService = new UserService ();

  private void Test () {
    var getUsersRequest = this.userService.Get ();
    var getUserRequest = this.userService.Get (id: "xyz");
    var createUserRequest = this.userService.Post (model: new User (...));
    var updateUserRequest = this.userService.Patch (model: new User (...));
    var deleteUserRequest = this.userService.Delete (id: "xyz");
  }
}
```

Once created your request using the builder, it's time to send it over to the API. To do this, yield the Send method provided by the builder.

```csharp
public class TestComponent : MonoBehaviour {
  private UserService userService = new UserService ();

  private IEnumerator Test () {
    var request = this.userService.Get ();
    yield return request.Send();
  }
}
```

To confirm a request was successfull or get the response body, use the GetResponse method after sending your request. When something went wrong, a request exception will be thrown containing information to display or debug the problem. Use the GetRawResponse method in order to get the raw response data, this method can also throw an exception.

```csharp
public class TestComponent : MonoBehaviour {
  private UserService userService = new UserService ();

  private IEnumerator Test () {
    var request = this.userService.Get ();
    yield return request.Send();
    try {
      var users = request.GetResponse ();
    }
    catch (RequestException exception) {
      Debug.Log (exception.statusCode);
    }
  }
}
```

## Chainable Options

#### Authorize `version 1.0.0`

Sets the authorization header allow the request to authorize itself on the server.

```csharp
public RequestBuilder<ModelType> Authorize (string token);
```

#### Populate `version 1.0.0`

This parameter allows you to populate references to other collections in the response.

```csharp
public RequestBuilder<ModelType> Populate (params string[] fields);
```

#### Filter `version 1.0.0` (Obsolete)

This parameter allows you to filter the response data on one or more fields on specific values. You can filter on multiple fields by chaing the filter method.

```csharp
public RequestBuilder<ModelType> Filter (string field, string filter);
```

#### Search `version 1.0.0` (Obsolete)

This parameter allows you to search through all fields of the response using the same value. Results matching the value in at least one of the fields will be shown in the response.

```csharp
public RequestBuilder<ModelType> Search (string query);
```

This parameter allows you to search through all fields of the response using the same value. Results matching the value in at least one of the fields will be shown in the response. You can limit the fields which fields in which the algorithm searches using the search scope parameter.

```csharp
public RequestBuilder<ModelType> Search (string query, params string[] scopes);
```

#### Pick `version 1.0.0`

This parameter allows you to define which fields you want the results to contain. If one or more fields have been picked for a layer, the remaining layers will be omitted from the response. You can deep pick fields by separating fields using a dot (f.e. brewers.name).

```csharp
public RequestBuilder<ModelType> Pick (params string[] fields);
```

#### Sort `version 1.0.0`

This parameter allows you to sort the response data on one or more fields in the desired order.

```csharp
public RequestBuilder<ModelType> Sort (params string[] fields);
```

```csharp
public RequestBuilder<ModelType> Sort (string field, bool descending);
```

#### Offset `version 1.0.0`

This parameter allows you to skip the first n number of results.

```csharp
public RequestBuilder<ModelType> Offset (int amount);
```

#### Limit `version 1.0.0`

This parameter allows you to limit the response to only show the next n number of results.

```csharp
public RequestBuilder<ModelType> Limit (int amount);
```

#### Distinct `version 1.0.0`

This parameter allows you to find the distinct values for a specified field. The returned models will each contain unique values for that field. When multiple models in the actual response would have the same value, the first encountered model will be chosen based on the sort attribute.

```csharp
public RequestBuilder<ModelType> Distinct (string field);
```

#### Random `version 1.0.0`

This parameter allows you to randomize the order of the response data. This parameter holds priority over the sort parameter which means that the sort will be omitted when random is defined.

```csharp
public RequestBuilder<ModelType> Random ();
```
