# Installation

Install the latest stable release using the Unity Package Manager by adding the following line to your `manifest.json` file located within your project's Packages directory.

```json
"nl.elraccoone.nest-utilities-client": "git+https://github.com/elraccoone/unity-nest-utilities-client"
```

# Documentation

The package revolves around the CrudService. Extending this service will grant you methods to call upon the endpoints generated by nest-utilities as well as the available options provided by the chainable request builder.

## Getting started

Creating a service for your resource is as simple as creating a new class and extending the crud service followed by some basic parameters and your model's type.

```csharp
using ElRaccoone.NestUtilitiesClient;

public class UserService : CrudService<User> {
  public UserService () : base (
    hostname: "my-awesome-api.com",
    resource: "user",
    useInsecureProtocol: false
  ) { }
}
```

To use your newly created service, create an instance somewhere in your application.

```csharp
public class TestComponent : MonoBehaviour {
  private UserService userService = new UserService ();

  private IEnumerator Start () {
    var request = this.userService.Get ("100");
    yield return request.Send();
    try {
      request.GetResponse ();
    }
    catch (RequestException exception) {
      exception.statusCode;
    }
  }
}
```
